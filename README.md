# Thetta DAO Framework 
**"OpenZeppelin for DAOs"**

Thetta DAO Framework is a DAO Framework that will help you to create your own DAO on top of it.
Code is modular, so you can use different subsystems almost independently.

## Disclaimer 

We are doing our best to keep the code quality at the very high level.
However: Thetta community and Thetta inc. can not garantee that code has no bugs. As long as any smart contract can involve real cryptocurrency -> please double check that you know what you are doing. 

Thetta DAO Framework CAN LEAD TO the monetary loss. Thetta has no liabilities.
